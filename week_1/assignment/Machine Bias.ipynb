    "\n",
    "The focus of this assignment will be on replicating and discussing the analysis of the **COMPAS recidivism algorithm** (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) made by ProPublica. See the [original article](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing) for reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is divided into three parts:\n",
    "1. **Before the laboratory** (individually): start by reading the [original article](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing) and the [methodology](https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm) used by the authors, and then perform the analysis proposed in Section 1 below. Your focus, before the laboratory, is to clearly understand the dataset and what it contains, as well as the claims made by ProPublica.\n",
    "2. **During the laboratory** (in groups): delve deeper into the 'fairness' and 'bias' aspects of this story. What do you think the authors mean by 'bias'? Which notion of 'fairness' they imply? Do you think their analysis supports their conclusions? Replicate (parts of) the original analysis and discuss results within your group, as detailed in Section 2 below. Make sure you refer to the [methodology](https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm) as you do this.\n",
    "3. **After the laboratory** (in groups): finish your replication and read critical discussions of ProPublica's work, found in [1](http://www.crj.org/assets/2017/07/9_Machine_bias_rejoinder.pdf), [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07524), [3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10154), [4](https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/7z10o269/release/4) or [5](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08230), among others. Write up your results and thoughts into a brief project report. Make sure to discuss the question of whether you think predictive systems should be used for this kind of screening activities at all, and if so when should you would consider them fair or *not* 'biased'.\n",

    "***Note: ProPublica's study has been criticized as flawed on several aspects. It is important that you maintain a critical outlook when replicating it, and read up such criticism when you are done with replication (step 3 above).***"

    "## 1- Descriptive analysis of the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please read these excerpts from the [methodology](https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm) first.**\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Data source**: Through a public records request, ProPublica obtained two years worth of COMPAS scores from the Broward County Sheriff’s Office in Florida. We received data for all 18,610 people who were scored in 2013 and 2014.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Data filtering**: Because Broward County primarily uses the score to determine whether to release or detain a defendant before his or her trial, we discarded scores that were assessed at parole, probation or other stages in the criminal justice system. That left us with 11,757 people who were assessed at the pretrial stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **COMPAS recidivism scores**: \n",
    "> * Each pretrial defendant received at least three COMPAS scores: “Risk of Recidivism,” “Risk of Violence” and “Risk of Failure to Appear.”\n",
    "> * COMPAS scores for each defendant ranged from 1 to 10, with ten being the highest risk. Scores 1 to 4 were labeled by COMPAS as “Low”; 5 to 7 were labeled “Medium”; and 8 to 10 were labeled “High.”\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Data enrichment**: \n",
    "> * Starting with the database of COMPAS scores, we built a profile of each person’s criminal history, both before and after they were scored. We collected public criminal records from the Broward County Clerk’s Office website through April 1, 2016. On average, defendants in our dataset were not incarcerated for 622.87 days (sd: 329.19).\n",
    "> * We matched the criminal records to the COMPAS records using a person’s first and last names and date of birth. This is the same technique used in the Broward County COMPAS validation study conducted by researchers at Florida State University in 2010. We downloaded around 80,000 criminal records from the Broward County Clerk’s Office website.\n",
    "> * To determine race, we used the race classifications used by the Broward County Sheriff’s Office, which identifies defendants as black, white, Hispanic, Asian and Native American. In 343 cases, the race was marked as Other.\n",
    "> * We also compiled each person’s record of incarceration. We received jail records from the Broward County Sheriff’s Office from January 2013 to April 2016, and we downloaded public incarceration records from the Florida Department of Corrections website.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Data evaluation**: We found that sometimes people’s names or dates of birth were incorrectly entered in some records – which led to incorrect matches between an individual’s COMPAS score and his or her criminal records. We attempted to determine how many records were affected. In a random sample of 400 cases, we found an error rate of 3.75 percent (CI: +/- 1.8 percent).\n",
    "\n",
    ">**How recidivism is defined**: Northpointe defined recidivism as “a finger-printable arrest involving a charge and a filing for any uniform crime reporting (UCR) code.” We interpreted that to mean a criminal offense that resulted in a jail booking and took place after the crime for which the person was COMPAS scored. [..] **For most of our analysis, we defined recidivism as a new arrest within two years.**"
