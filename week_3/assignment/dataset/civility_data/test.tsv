@USER Yeah sucks honestly but I plan on coming back on variety rather than fortnite and if the opportunities are nice to start esport on another game but I can approve that fortnite esport is over for me.
@USER The fact that we believe that these are the only two conservatives with a shred of decency is deeply disturbing. Even more disturbing is that I don’t believe either of them do either. Still doesn’t hurt to try.

Can't believe I didn't do cardio today. Did you?
@USER @USER The sort of thing #Antifa and the socialists of @USER would cheer.
@USER @USER so and accusation by a libtarded Trump hating liberal activist against a Trump appointee doesnt make u wonder if the accusation was politically motivated in the SLIGHTEST?  No? This is why conservatives think u are all stupid. Because u are.
@USER @USER Boom!
The only thing I can say right now is why..

@USER @USER just call them if someone found it they'd keep it. My mom doesn't know anything about the phone She didn't clean
@USER @USER I completely agree; which is why a potential victim's claim must be afforded due process before she (or he) is villianized.
@USER what's wrong with a Honda civic?
I'll be married by the end of 2015. Usually my predictions come true.

@USER @USER @USER @USER Don’t let the MSM keep calling it a second referendum. As there will be a Remain in EU option it is really a People’s Vote. One problem with 3 options could be just over 1/3 is bigger than just under 2/3. Perhaps 2 stages would be better.
&amp; then they talk foreverrrrrrrrr.
Cheers to the freakin weekend
