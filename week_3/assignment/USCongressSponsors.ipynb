    "In this project, we will work through a real world example looking at collaboration networks in the US Congress. It is an advanced example, but I nevertheless wanted to show you how you can work through a real dataset. It is typical in the sense in terms of the data challenges you face with social data as well as the kind of new questions you can ask.\n",

    "Legislatures are inherently difficult to investigate. Political scientists have been interested in collaborations among parliamentarians as explanatory factors in legislative behavior for decades. But up to now they have lacked the data to do this on a larger scale. Recently, legislatures around the world have begun to to publish all their workings on the web. Especially advanced is the US Congress. Take a look at  https://www.congress.gov/. \n",

    "In this exercise, we will first download a sample of bills and then investigate sponsors and cosponsors of these bills. If you do not know much about the workings of the US congress, take a look at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponsor_(legislative) \n",

    "First we load a couple of libraries that we need. Some you will recognise. Hopefully, all the libraries should have been installed for you beforehand if you use a framework like Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/). But if at any moment in time Python does not recognise the library, you can simply install it by following the instructions at https://www.codecademy.com/articles/install-python."

    "This is why we would like to try another approach. We will try to learn rules that represent the data. We imagine that it should be possible this way to determine rules like if senator x proposes a bill, congresswoman y will be involved, too, as she is associated with him. \n",
    "\n",
    "Association rules are often used for 'market basket analysis', which are typical example for analysing very sparse datasets. The result of a market basket analysis is a set of association rules that specify patterns of relationships among items. A typical rule might be expressed in the form: \n",
    "\n",
    "- {peanut butter, jelly} -> {bread}. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, if a costumer buys peanut butter and jelly, she will also get bread. We will try to learn something similar by associating US congress members who sponsor bills together. If congresswoman X sponsors a bill, so will senator Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the most-widely used approach for efficiently analysing large data for rules is known as Apriori. This algorithm was introduced in 1994 by R. Agrawal and R. Srikant, and has become somewhat synonymous with association rule learning since then. Check out: Fast algorithms for mining association rule, in Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Very Large Databases, pp. 487-499, by R. Agrawal, and R.Srikant, (1994).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, I found that the apriori algorithm (https://pbpython.com/market-basket-analysis.html) is extremely slow in Python. So, rather than Apriori we will use a faster version (http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/user_guide/frequent_patterns/fpgrowth/) that implements Han, Jiawei, Jian Pei, Yiwen Yin, and Runying Mao. \"Mining frequent patterns without candidate generation. \"A frequent-pattern tree approach.\" Data mining and knowledge discovery 8, no. 1 (2004): 53-87. It concentrates on frequent itemsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"FP-Growth is an algorithm for extracting frequent itemsets with applications in association rule learning that emerged as a popular alternative to the established Apriori algorighm. In general, the algorithm has been designed to operate on databases containing transactions, such as purchases by customers of a store. An itemset is considered as 'frequent' if it meets a user-specified support threshold. For instance, if the support threshold is set to 0.5 (50%), a frequent itemset is defined as a set of items that occur together in at least 50% of all transactions in the database.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We follow the examples given at http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/user_guide/frequent_patterns/fpgrowth/ including the TransactionEncoder. But we could have actually reduced the steps, as we have already have sponsors_cosponsors_matrix, as we will later see. "
