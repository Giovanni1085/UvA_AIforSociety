    "##  Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project trains you on the essentials of exploratory data analysis (EDA) with Python. There are many excellent resources and books. For a recent introducion, check out Suresh Kumar Mukhiya, Usman Ahmed, Hands-On Exploratory Data Analysis with Python, Pack Publishing, 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks are particularly suited for EDA. Let's repeat quickly why.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks are interactive environments to work and share your code for a project and reuse the recipes. They combine plain text with rich text elements such as graphics, calculations, etc. and executable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are  working with a sort of text editor in which you indicate your code chunks and your pure text components. The document is self contained and fully reproducible which makes it very easy to share.\n",
    "\n",
    "What's great about working with these notebooks is the fact that you can follow up on the execution of your code chunks, thanks to visual feeedbacks on the completion of code when you're executing large chunks or multiple chunks at once. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks have options to run a code chunk or run the next chunk, run all code chunks below and above. In addition to these options, you can also choose to restart the Python kernel and run all chunks or to restart and to clear the output. \n",
    "\n",
    "You have the option to run a single cell, to run several cells or to run all cells. You can also choose to clear the current or all outputs. The code environment is shared between code cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook Sharing\n",
    "\n",
    "You can easily create an HTML file from the notebook that you can share with other people that do not have the same environment set up."

    "## Example project\n",
    "\n",
    "EDA is sometimes treated as a step towards a deeper predictive analyis, but it really is a very powerful kind of analysis in its own right - especially if the dataset is not very large or very complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example project, we continues our debate today on analysing votes in parliaments with Python. We will use the dataset by Erik Voeten in 'Data and Analyses of Voting in the UN General Assembly', Routledge Handbook of International Organization, edited by Bob Reinalda (published May 27, 2013)\n",
    "https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2111149. \n",
