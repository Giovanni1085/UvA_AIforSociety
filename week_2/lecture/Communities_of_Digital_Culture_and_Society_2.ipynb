    "We have just discussed how clustering can be an effective tool to understand political behaviour. As an unsupervised learning technique it provides a new machine reading on party affiliations. Another popular application of clustering is detecting communities in social relationships.  Next we go through an example and dataset in Brett Lantz’s excellent book on Machine Learning (Lantz, B. (2013). Packt Publishing Ltd.). The dataset is discussed on pp. 279. It covers the relationships in a Social Networking Service (SNS). While this is a fairly early SNS dataset, it is freely available and offers similar kind of insights you can gain from my recent examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "This section also introduces you to the intersection of digital marketing techniques and sociological studies of online networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lantz explains that the dataset was compiled for sociological research on teenage identities at Notre Dame University. It represents a random sample of 30,000 US high school students who had profiles on a well-known SNS in 2006. At the time the data was collected, the SNS was a popular web destination for U.S. teenagers. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the profiles represent a fairly wide cross section of American adolescents in 2006. The data was sampled evenly across four high school graduation years (2006 through 2009) representing the senior, junior, second-year and freshman classes at the time of data collection. Then, the full texts of the SNS profiles were downloaded. Each teen's gender, age and number of SNS friends was recorded. \n",
    "\n",
    "A text-mining tool was used to divide the remaining SNS page content into words. From the top 500 words appearing across all pages, 36 words were chosen to represent five categories of interests, namely extracurricular activities, fashion, religion, romance and antisocial behaviour. The 36 words include terms such as football, sexy, kissed, bible, shopping, death, drugs, etc. The final dataset indicates, for each person, how many times each word appeared in the person's SNS profile. \n",

    "The web has become a unique source of data for social analysis. Munzert et al. (2014) in their book on 'Automated data collection (...). A practical guide to web scraping and text mining' (John Wiley & Sons) emphasize in the Introduction that 'the rapid growth of the World Wide Web over the past two decades tremendously changed the way we share, collect, and publish data. Firms, public institutions, and private users provide every imaginable type of information and new channels of communication generate vast amounts of data on human behavior. What was once a fundamental problem for the social sciences — the scarcity and inaccessibility of observations — is quickly turning into an abundance of data. This turn of events does not come without problems. (…), traditional techniques for collecting and analyzing data may no longer suffice to overcome the tangled masses of data.' (p. XV). \n",
    "\n",
    "In short, we can find lots of data on the web. A big problem with web data is, however, that it is often inconsistent and heterogeneous. To get access to it, one often has to visit multiple web sites and assemble their data together. Finally, the data is generally published without reuse in mind, which implies that the data can be of low quality. That said, the web is so vast that it still provides an often overwhelming source of exciting data. \n",
