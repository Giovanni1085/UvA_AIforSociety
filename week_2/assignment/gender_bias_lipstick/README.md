These materials are a partial replication of [Bolukbasi et al. 2016](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.06520.pdf) "Man is to Computer Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker? Debiasing Word Embeddings", and their assessment by [Gonen and Goldberg 2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.03862.pdf) "Lipstick on a Pig: Debiasing Methods Cover up Systematic Gender Biases in Word Embeddings But do not Remove Them".

For a detailed explanation of the experiments, see the original papers. 

*This folder is a partial fork with minor changes from Gonen and Goldberg's code, which can be found here: https://github.com/gonenhila/gender_bias_lipstick (a link to the embeddings is given there).*

We use the Word2Vec model from https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec, and its debiased version from [Bolukbasi et al. 2016](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.06520.pdf).
